The pipeline described in this repository had been used for mRNA seq analysis in the paper titled:
"Transcriptomic pathway discovery in Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome: a causal network inference approach."

Follow the preprocessing pipeline 00_mRNAseq_pipeline_De_Bellis.md, and for Differential Expressed Genes analysis using  the script 01_Deseq2_DEG.R. 

Instead the file 02_rRNAhomo_sapiens_decontamination.fa contains the human rRNA sequence, that had been used for rRNA decontamination.
